# p5snakegame
An emulation of the snake game.

## Introduction
Built for All-Star Code Week 2 Group Project. The game works just like the snake game, where the user controls the snake and tries to eat the apple. With a time limit of under 2 hours to build the game, I was given the task of the collision radius of the snake and apple and accomplished it to further the development.

## Technologies Used

JavaScript (p5 library), HTML, CSS
